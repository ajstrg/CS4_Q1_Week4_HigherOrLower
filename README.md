# CS4_Q1_Week4_HigherOrLower

## Task

Imagine that youâ€™re trying to make a simple guessing game.
The application will generate a random number from 0 to 10 and the user is given a number of tries to guess it.
Every time the user guesses, it will respond by saying if the number is higher or lower.
The game ends if the user is able to guess the number or if the number of guesses runs out.
Include a settings option at the start which will allow the user to change the range and/or the number of guesses.
